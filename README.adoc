# Call Center

Call center that has the capacity to handle up to N concurrent calls.

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 1.8
- Maven 3.3.x

## How it works

The call dispatcher can handle up to N concurrent calls, as long as there are free employees.

- When a new call arrives, the dispatcher looks for a free employee to answer it, in order of priority: operators first, supervisors and finally directors.
- If it finds a free operator, the call is dispatched.
- If not, all employees are busy. The dispatcher waits for a new free employee (blocks its process).
- When an employee finishes a call, it unblocks the dispatcher process.
- If a call arrives and the dispatcher capacity is full, it waits until the dispatcher can handle it.
